	Input : 
		An integer (binaryNumber)
		
	Output :
		An integer (decimalNumber)
		
	Procedure :
		First, read the binary number from the user.
		Assign, 0 to exponent and decimalNumber.
		Use a repeat loop, to divide the binanyNumber by 10 again and again till we get 0.
		Inside the loop, take the first digit every time, multiple it by the exponent 2 with the existing exponent number.
		Add the above with the decimalNumber again and again and store it in decimalNumber only.
		Increment the exponent.
		Write the result.
